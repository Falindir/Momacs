Momacs is a digitalization interface for 2D morphometrics data. It is intentend as an open-source alternative to tpsDig, in R. So far, it is quite experimental and it is part of the [MomX](https://momx.github.io/MomX/) ecosystem.

Momacs benefited from the [Montpellier Bioinformatics Biodiversity](http://mbb.univ-montp2.fr/) platform services. 

### Installation
The last released version can be installed from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Momacs ) with (NOT YET RELEASED!):

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("Momacs")
```

But I recommend using (and only support) the development version from GitHub with:
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MomX/Momacs")
```

### Features
For supported images ("jpeg", "gif", "bmp", "png", "jpg") the following 2D features can be acquired:

* Batch of images that can be zoomed, moved, etc.
* Landmarks
* Open/closed curves/polygons
* Configurable shortcuts and cosmetics

### Planned

* Better looking and more productive user interface
* Bezier curves
* Integration of outlines
* Post treatment of images, possibly using [Momoshop](https://github.com/vbonhomme/Momoshop)
